# Hi there, I'm Muhammad Elladan 👋

I'm a final‑year cybersecurity student specialising in **security operations and digital forensics**.  My days are spent hunting threats in lab environments, tuning detection rules and learning how real‑world attackers operate.  I'm currently open to **remote SOC analyst internships**, **volunteer roles** and preparing to pursue a **master’s degree in Japan**.

## 🧭 What I’m focusing on

- **Security Operations** – log collection, correlation and alert triage using tools like Splunk, ELK and Wazuh.
- **Digital Forensics & IR** – endpoint telemetry, memory/disk analysis and building concise incident reports.
- **Threat Intelligence** – aggregating and automating IOC feeds, writing YARA rules and tracking emerging malware.
- **Network Monitoring** – configuring Snort/Zeek sensors and writing custom signatures to detect command‑and‑control traffic.

## 🔨 My Projects

I believe the best way to learn is by building. Each project highlights the tools I used, the skills I gained and the outcomes achieved.  Here are a few examples:

| Project | Summary | Key Skills |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [**SOC Lab: Phishing Simulation & Detection (GoPhish)**](https://github.com/MaesterLaiden/SOC-Lab-Phishing-Simulation-Detection-GoPhish-) — Ran a safe, self-targeted phishing simulation with GoPhish using authenticated SMTP and SPF/DKIM/DMARC; captured delivery/open/click/submission telemetry; mapped SOC detections plus an IR mini-playbook. | Phishing simulation | Detection engineering, Incident response, VPS, SMTP Server, Basic HTML |
| [**Kill Chain + MITRE ATT&CK Mapping: Phishing → Ransomware**](https://github.com/MaesterLaiden/Mini-Project-Phishing-Ransomware-Kill-Chain-MITRE-ATT-CK-) — Mapped the attack across the Cyber Kill Chain and MITRE ATT&CK; produced a one-page detection cheat-sheet for SOC Tier-1 (email/perimeter, host/EDR, network, impact/recovery). | Attack Simulation | Threat modeling, Detection engineering, SIEM use-cases, Windows logging, ATT&CK |
| [**Android Spyware Pentest Using AndroRAT**](https://github.com/MaesterLaiden/Android-Spyware-Pentest-Using-AndroRAT) — Built a modern React/TypeScript streaming app (StreamFlix) and used it as a lab to explore Android’s install/update trust boundaries, payload‑dropping techniques, and Cloudflare‑tunnelled C2 communication via AndroRAT; documented the full process and defensive insights. | Pentesting | (React/TypeScript, TMDb API), Android internals & packaging (first‑run flows, FileProvider, APK signing & alignment), network tunnelling (Cloudflare Tunnel over CGNAT), ethical penetration testing & reporting, API Integration and Data Handling, Operating System Constrains, Kali Linux, Metasploitable Msvenom |
| [**Finding Broken Function Level BFLA IDOR**](https://github.com/MaesterLaiden/Finding-Broken-Function-Level-BFLA-IDOR) — Published a detailed security research report on Broken Function-Level Authorization (BFLA/IDOR) in a developer portal. | Web Application Security Assesment | Application Security, Web Security Testing, Vulnerability Assessment, OWASP Top 10, Broken Access Control, IDOR, Burp Suite, Session Management, Secure API Design, Authorization Testing, Penetration Testing, Responsible Disclosure, CVSS Scoring, Security Reporting, GitHub Documentation |

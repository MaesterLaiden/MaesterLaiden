<!-- GitHub profile README for MaesterLaiden -->

# Hi there, I'm Muhammad Elladan 👋

I'm a final‑year cybersecurity student specialising in **security operations and digital forensics**.  My days are spent hunting threats in lab environments, tuning detection rules and learning how real‑world attackers operate.  I'm currently open to **remote SOC analyst internships**, **volunteer roles** and preparing to pursue a **master’s degree in Japan**.

## 🧭 What I’m focusing on

- **Security Operations** – log collection, correlation and alert triage using tools like Splunk, ELK and Wazuh.
- **Digital Forensics & IR** – endpoint telemetry, memory/disk analysis and building concise incident reports.
- **Threat Intelligence** – aggregating and automating IOC feeds, writing YARA rules and tracking emerging malware.
- **Network Monitoring** – configuring Snort/Zeek sensors and writing custom signatures to detect command‑and‑control traffic.

## 🔨 My Projects

I believe the best way to learn is by building.  That’s why I maintain a **[SOC Analyst portfolio website](https://maesterlaiden.github.io/soc-analyst-portfolio/)** with interactive project cards, write‑ups and source code.  Each project highlights the tools I used, the skills I gained and the outcomes achieved.  Here are a few examples:

| Project | Summary | Key Skills |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Personalised SIEM Implementation** | Built a custom SIEM pipeline using the ELK stack, centralising logs and creating dashboards to surface brute‑force and malware activity. | Log management, event correlation, threat detection |
| **Threat Intelligence Pipeline** | Integrated OpenCTI and MISP feeds with YARA scanning for automated IOC ingestion and weekly threat briefings. | Threat intelligence, automation, YARA |
| **Network Traffic Analysis** | Deployed Snort and Zeek, analysed live packet captures and wrote rules to detect lateral movement and beaconing. | Network analysis, signature development, incident reporting |

Visit the portfolio for more projects, details and images.  I’m constantly adding new work as I complete labs and challenges.

## 🎓 Certifications & Goals

- Completed training and hands‑on labs through **TryHackMe** and **Hack The Box**.
- Working towards **CompTIA Security+** and **eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT)** certifications.
- Planning to pursue a **master’s degree in cybersecurity in Japan** after graduation.

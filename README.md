# Hi there, I'm Muhammad Elladan 👋

I'm a final‑year cybersecurity student specialising in **security operations and digital forensics**.  My days are spent hunting threats in lab environments, tuning detection rules and learning how real‑world attackers operate.  I'm currently open to **remote SOC analyst internships**, **volunteer roles** and preparing to pursue a **master’s degree in Japan**.

## 🧭 What I’m focusing on

- **Security Operations** – log collection, correlation and alert triage using tools like Splunk, ELK and Wazuh.
- **Digital Forensics & IR** – endpoint telemetry, memory/disk analysis and building concise incident reports.
- **Threat Intelligence** – aggregating and automating IOC feeds, writing YARA rules and tracking emerging malware.
- **Network Monitoring** – configuring Snort/Zeek sensors and writing custom signatures to detect command‑and‑control traffic.

## 🔨 My Projects

I believe the best way to learn is by building. Each project highlights the tools I used, the skills I gained and the outcomes achieved.  Here are a few examples:

| Project | Summary | Key Skills |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [**SOC Lab: Phishing Simulation & Detection (GoPhish)**](https://github.com/MaesterLaiden/SOC-Lab-Phishing-Simulation-Detection-GoPhish-) — Ran a safe, self-targeted phishing simulation with GoPhish using authenticated SMTP and SPF/DKIM/DMARC; captured delivery/open/click/submission telemetry; mapped SOC detections plus an IR mini-playbook. | Phishing simulation | Detection engineering | Incident response |
| **Threat Intelligence Pipeline** | Integrated OpenCTI and MISP feeds with YARA scanning for automated IOC ingestion and weekly threat briefings. | Threat intelligence, automation, YARA |
| **Network Traffic Analysis** | Deployed Snort and Zeek, analysed live packet captures and wrote rules to detect lateral movement and beaconing. | Network analysis, signature development, incident reporting |

## 🎓 Certifications & Goals

- Earned a Pre-Security Certificate on Try-Hack me https://tryhackme.com/certificate/THM-BKNUVPLN75
- Working towards **CompTIA Security+** and **eLearnSecurity Security Operations Center 1)** certifications.
- Planning to pursue a **master’s degree in cybersecurity in Japan** after graduation early 2026.
